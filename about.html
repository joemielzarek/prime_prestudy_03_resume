    <h1>LONG STORY. LONG.</h1>

    <p>I am driven by stories that impact, influence and inspire others. I am an obsessive planner and multi-tasking master with an excitement for the little things in life. After completing a year’s worth of college credit while still in high school (Go
      Polars!), I poised myself to graduate a year earlier than my peers. A few energy drinks and many late nights later, I completed my undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota (Go Gophers!) when I was 20—nerd alert. Colleagues agree that
      my professional experience is as equally impressive as my academic achievements. Before entering the ad world, I took the helm of the marketing department at the Saint Paul Festival and Heritage Foundation and sharpened their marketing efforts. In
      addition, gaining experiences from whirlwind organizations including the Minnesota State Fair and the Saint Paul Winter Carnival taught me to execute with precision in a very short time frame. I cut my teeth as an Account Manager at Hunt Adkins.
      I’ve learned a little bit of everything and a lot about communication in my time with them. From this I found that it’s time to move on to a new pasture where I can grow my skills and begin my journey as a software engineer.</p>
